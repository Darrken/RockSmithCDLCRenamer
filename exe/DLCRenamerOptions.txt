Artist-Song-Separator: "_"
Space-Character: "-"
Use-Metadata-Version: false
Use-Metadata-DD: false

# The Artist-Song-Separator sets the character between Artist - Song - Version - DD
#  ex: Cure_Burn_v1_DD_p.psarc

# The Space-Character sets the character used for spaces in an Artist name or Song title
#  ex: Arctic-Monkeys_Do-I-Wanna-Know_v1_p.psarc

# Use-Metadata-Version: 
#  If true, this will get the version number from the file metadata if it exists
#   (many song authors at this time do not fill in the version metadata, so you may end up with a lot of "v1" in your filenames)
#  If false, the renamer will attempt to get the version in the existing filename

# Use-Metadata-DD:
#  If true, the renamer will attempt to determine whether the song supports Dynamic Difficulty from file metadata.  May not be 100% accurate.
#  If false, the renamer will just look for "_DD" in the existing filename
